## Additional Note
For this project, we were given a large amount of starter code and direction from our instructor. We were told to use this code and complete the areas that say TODO in the src-sw, webpack.config, database, and install JS files in the client folder. I have left in the TODO comments so that the grader may see where original code was supposed to be implemented.
